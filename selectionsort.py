def sort(numbers):

# This outer loop keeps track of where the
# unsorted portion of the list begins.
    for idx in range(len(numbers)-1):
    # Each time we come into the body of this outer loop, we are doing 
    # one pass. Remember that a pass is made up of a search and a swap.
    #
    # Here is the code to search for and find the smallest value. We've 
    # seen this before and know that it uses a for loop (so we've got
    # nested loops).
    # What we really need to know is the INDEX of the smallest value,
    # so we'll keep track of that. As long as we have an index, we can
    # go back into the list to get the value.
    #
    # Remember, we only want to search in the unsorted portion of the
    # list. Where does that section begin? At index idx.

        idxSmallest = idx; # initialization
        for i in range(idx + 1, len(numbers)):
            if numbers[i] > numbers[idxSmallest]:  # found a new smallest value,
                idxSmallest = i;  # so remember its subscript

    # now that we've found the index of the smallest value, swap it into place
        temp = numbers[idx]
        numbers[idx] = numbers[idxSmallest]
        numbers[idxSmallest] = temp
    # End of function, but nothing to "return" -- the list itself has been changed!
