# GuiTest3.py
# This sample program demonstrates drawing shapes
# on a canvas using some Gui tools.
#
# This program is not interactive.  It draws the same
# picture every time it is executed.
#
# To run this program, you must save the file Gui3.py
# in the same folder as this program.
#
# You can use this sample as starter code for drawing-related
# lab exercises and homework assignments.  Just save a copy of
# the file with a new name, add your own function definitions,
# and change the code in the 'main' function.
#
# Pay careful attention to the use of [] to specify points
# and lists of points.  We'll talk more about this later...
