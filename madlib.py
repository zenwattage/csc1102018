#Report
# I went about starting the assignment by pasting in the lyrics I was using.
# I then went about picking the words I would replace and creating the variables.
# Tried to design questions to draw a specific response so as to create the song.
# Adjusted the print statements to get a more pleasing output presentation.

# I tested my program by running it, checking the output, then adjusting the code.

# I learned some ways to format my output while trying to get multiple lines
# with multiple variables to print the way I wanted in a single print statement.
